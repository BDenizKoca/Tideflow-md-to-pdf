# Theme Showcase

This comprehensive document demonstrates all major formatting features to help you evaluate and compare different PDF themes. Each section showcases how themes handle various typographic elements, spacing, colors, and structural components.

## Typography & Headings

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the alphabet and helps visualize how the theme renders body text. Notice the **bold emphasis**, *italic styling*, and ***bold italic combination*** within running text.

### Level 2 Heading: Medium Emphasis

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. Each theme applies different font families, sizes, weights, and spacing to create a unique reading experience.

#### Level 3 Heading: Subtle Hierarchy

Even smaller headings maintain visual hierarchy through the theme's carefully calibrated heading scale, font weights, and accent color treatments.

## Text Formatting Options

This section demonstrates inline formatting capabilities:

- **Bold text** creates strong emphasis and draws attention to key terms
- *Italic text* provides subtle emphasis for foreign words, titles, or gentle stress
- ***Combined bold and italic*** for maximum typographic emphasis
- `Inline code` uses monospace fonts for technical terms, commands, or code snippets
- ~~Strikethrough text~~ indicates removed content or corrections
- Regular body text for standard paragraph content and flowing prose
- Text with [hyperlinks](https://example.com) to see link styling and colors

## Lists & Enumeration

### Lists

Simple bullet lists for non-sequential items:

- First level item
- Second level item

Sequential numbered lists for procedures:

1. First level item
2. Second level item

Complex bullet lists with longer content:

- **Project Planning**: Define clear objectives, establish timelines, allocate resources, and identify potential risks before beginning implementation
- **Execution Phase**: Follow established protocols, maintain communication channels, track progress metrics, and adapt to changing requirements
- **Review & Iteration**: Gather feedback, analyze results, document lessons learned, and refine processes for future projects

## Block Quotes

> "The details are not the details. They make the design."
>
> — Charles Eames

> Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form, and thus with an independent existence. Its heartwood is calligraphy—the dance, on a tiny stage, of the living, speaking hand—and its roots reach into living soil, though its branches may be hung each year with new machines.

## Tables

Tables demonstrate grid layout, borders, and cell formatting:

| Feature | Description | Priority | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Typography | Font selection and hierarchy | High | Complete |
| Color Scheme | Theme colors and accents | High | Complete |
| Spacing | Margins, padding, line height | Medium | In Progress |
| Code Blocks | Syntax highlighting support | Medium | Planned |
| Tables | Grid layout and styling | Low | Testing |

Financial data example:

| Quarter | Revenue | Expenses | Profit | Growth |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Q1 2025 | $125,000 | $87,000 | $38,000 | +12% |
| Q2 2025 | $142,000 | $91,000 | $51,000 | +34% |
| Q3 2025 | $156,000 | $98,000 | $58,000 | +14% |
| Q4 2025 | $171,000 | $103,000 | $68,000 | +17% |

## Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules create visual breaks between sections:

---

Different themes style these dividers with varying thickness, color, and spacing.

## Mixed Content Example

When working with **complex documents**, you'll often need to combine multiple formatting types. For instance, you might have a paragraph that introduces a concept, followed by a code example:

```typescript
interface Theme {
  name: string;
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    accent: string;
  };
  typography: {
    font: string;
    size: number;
  };
}
```

After the code, you might provide additional explanation with *emphasized terms* and `technical references`, then summarize key points in a list:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform styling throughout
2. **Hierarchy**: Use headings and spacing to guide readers
3. **Readability**: Choose appropriate font sizes and line heights
4. **Aesthetics**: Balance functional design with visual appeal
